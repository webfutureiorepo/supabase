## Building the app

Start building the SolidJS app from scratch.

### Initialize a SolidJS app

You can use [degit](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit) to initialize an app called `supabase-solid`:

```bash
npx degit solidjs/templates/ts supabase-solid
cd supabase-solid
```

Then install the only additional dependency: [supabase-js](https://github.com/supabase/supabase-js)

```bash
npm install @supabase/supabase-js
```

And finally save the environment variables in a `.env` with the API URL and the key that you copied [earlier](#get-api-details).

<$CodeTabs>

<$CodeSample
  path="/user-management/solid-user-management/.env.example"
  lines={[[1, -1]]}
  meta="name=.env"
/>

</$CodeTabs>

Now that you have the API credentials in place, create a helper file to initialize the Supabase client. These variables will be exposed
on the browser, and that's completely fine since you have [Row Level Security](/docs/guides/auth#row-level-security) enabled on the Database.

<$CodeTabs>

<$CodeSample
  path="/user-management/solid-user-management/src/supabaseClient.tsx"
  lines={[[1, -1]]}
  meta="name=src/supabaseClient.tsx"
/>

</$CodeTabs>

### App styling (optional)

An optional step is to update the CSS file `src/index.css` to make the app look better.
You can find the full contents of this file [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/supabase/supabase/master/examples/user-management/solid-user-management/src/index.css).

### Set up a login component

Set up a SolidJS component to manage logins and sign ups using Magic Links, so users can sign in with their email without using passwords.

<$CodeTabs>

<$CodeSample
  path="/user-management/solid-user-management/src/Auth.tsx"
  lines={[[1, -1]]}
  meta="name=src/Auth.tsx"
/>

</$CodeTabs>

### Account page

After a user is signed in allow them to edit their profile details and manage their account.

Create a new component for that called `Account.tsx`.

<$CodeTabs>

<$CodeSample
  path="/user-management/solid-user-management/src/Account.tsx"
  lines={[[1, 1], [3, 78], [87, -1]]}
  meta="name=src/Account.tsx"
/>

</$CodeTabs>

### Launch!

Now that you have all the components in place, update `App.tsx`:

<$CodeTabs>

<$CodeSample
  path="/user-management/solid-user-management/src/App.tsx"
  lines={[[1, -1]]}
  meta="name=src/App.tsx"
/>

</$CodeTabs>

Once that's done, run this in a terminal window:

```bash
npm start
```

And then open the browser to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and you should see the completed app.

## Bonus: Profile photos

Every Supabase project is configured with [Storage](/docs/guides/storage) for managing large files like photos and videos.

### Create an upload widget

Create an avatar for the user so that they can upload a profile photo. Start by creating a new component:

<$CodeTabs>

<$CodeSample
  path="/user-management/solid-user-management/src/Avatar.tsx"
  lines={[[1, -1]]}
  meta="name=src/Avatar.tsx"
/>

</$CodeTabs>

### Add the new widget

And then add the widget to the Account page:

<$CodeTabs>

<$CodeSample
  path="/user-management/solid-user-management/src/Account.tsx"
  lines={[[1, 3], [76, 88]]}
  meta="name=src/Account.tsx"
/>

</$CodeTabs>

At this stage you have a fully functional application!
